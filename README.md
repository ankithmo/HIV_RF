# To predict kidney disease among individuals who have HIV. 

People living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) are at high risk for **kidney disease** and 
**renal failure** since the virus attacks the kidney, and even when HIV is under 
control (through anti-retrovirus therapy), the drugs the individual needs to take 
may be toxic to the kidneys.  Some behaviors may also elevate risk for kidney 
disease, like smoking, alcohol use, or substance use.  There are also demographic 
risk factors that lead to kidney damage and kidney disease --- for instance, 
kidney disease is more prevalent among African Americans and older individuals 
--- and having other diseases, like cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, 
hypertension, hepatitis B and C virus (HCV) can also raise the risk of kidney 
disease.
